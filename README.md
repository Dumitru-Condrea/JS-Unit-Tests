# JS Unit Tests: Array Manipulation Demonstration

## Overview
This project is a comprehensive demonstration of JavaScript unit testing techniques, focusing on array manipulation and 
advanced testing strategies. Created by Dumitru Condrea, it showcases best practices in test-driven development, logging,
and modular code organization.

## Why This Matters
This project isn't just about array manipulationâ€”it's a comprehensive demonstration of:
- Clean code principles
- Testable code design
- Modular architecture
- Advanced JavaScript techniques
- Sophisticated logging and testing strategies

## Project Structure 

The project is organized into several key directories and modules:
- `src/`: Main source code for array manipulation
- `src/utils/`: Utility modules for logging, performance tracking, and string manipulation
- `test/`: Mocha test suites for validating array operations

## Key Features

- Advanced logging system with console and file output
- Colorized console logs
- Flexible test hooks and step tracking
- Random word generation for test data
- Comprehensive unit tests for array operations

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Mocha (Testing Framework)
- Chai (Assertion Library)
- Chalk (Console Styling)
- Random-words (Test Data Generation)
- Dotenv (Environment Configuration)

## Test Scenarios Covered

The test suite validates the following array operations:
1. Array initialization
2. Adding unique values
3. Removing values
4. Type conversion
5. Preventing duplicate entries

## Logging Capabilities

The project includes a sophisticated logging system that supports:
- Timestamped logs
- Multiple output modes (console, file, or both)
- Colorized log messages
- Configurable logging levels

## Setup and Running Tests

1. Clone the repository
2. Download and install [Node.Js package](https://nodejs.org/en/download/prebuilt-installer) 
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
4. Execute tests with `npm test`

## Configuration

Logging can be configured via the `logs-config.env` file, allowing customization of:
- Log output mode
- Console color support

## License

Private project for demonstration purposes.
